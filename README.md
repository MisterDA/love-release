[Lua][lua] 5.1 script that makes [LÖVE][love] game release easier (previously Bash script).  
Automates LÖVE [Game Distribution][game_dist].  
LÖVE [forum topic][forum_topic].  
Available as a [LuaRocks][luarocks] [package][package].

## Features
love-release makes your LÖVE game release easier. It can create from your sources Windows executables, MacOS X applications, Debian packages and simple LÖVE files.

love-release creates only one LÖVE file per release directory and keeps it synced with your sources.

love-release can extract its informations from the environment: it guesses your game's title from the directory where it's stored, selects by default the latest LÖVE version from the web or uses its latest bundled LÖVE version, then parses the `conf.lua` file to extract even more informations such as the real LÖVE version your project uses.

### Usage
```
Usage: love-release [-D] [-M] [-a <author>] [-b] [-d <desc>]
       [-e <email>] [-l <love>] [-p <package>] [-t <title>] [-u <url>]
       [--uti <uti>] [-v <v>] [-X <exclude>] [--version] [-h] [<release>] [<source>]
       [-W [32|64]]

### Configuration
love-release prints to the command-line a Lua table containing the informations it uses to generate your project. These informations can be stored in your `conf.lua` file to be used later.

```lua
function love.conf(t)
  t.releases = {
    title = nil,              -- The project title (string)
    package = nil,            -- The project command and package name (string)
    loveVersion = nil,        -- The project LÖVE version
    version = nil,            -- The project version
    author = nil,             -- Your name (string)
    email = nil,              -- Your email (string)
    description = nil,        -- The project description (string)
    homepage = nil,           -- The project homepage (string)
    identifier = nil,         -- The project Uniform Type Identifier (string)
    excludeFileList = {},     -- File patterns to exclude. (string list)
    releaseDirectory = nil,   -- Where to store the project releases (string)
  }
end
```

## Installation

### Dependencies
love-release is only installable through LuaRocks and highly depends on LuaRocks internal API. love-release is currently build on LuaRocks 2.3.0. LuaRocks API is not meant to be stable, and a future update could break love-release. As love-release is made for LÖVE, it is written for Lua 5.1.

#### Required
- [libzip][libzip] headers for lua-zip.
- [lua-zip][lua-zip] has no official stable version, thus while available on LuaRocks it must be installed manually.
- Other libraries are automatically installed, but let's give them some credit: [luafilesystem][lfs], [loadconf][loadconf], [middleclass][middleclass], [semver][semver].

#### Optional
- `love` can be used to determine your system LÖVE version.
- `fakeroot` and `dpkg-deb` are required to create Debian packages.
- [LuaJIT][luajit] can be used to compile your sources, either with `luarocks-luajit` or if `luajit` is installed.

### Install

```sh
# sudo
luarocks install --server=http://luarocks.org/dev lua-zip

# latest stable version
luarocks install love-release

# development version
luarocks install --server=http://luarocks.org/dev love-release
```

### Remove Bash version
You may have previously installed the Bash version of love-release. You can remove it with the following piece of code. Take the time to assure yourself that the paths are correct and match your installation of love-release.

```sh
rm -rf '/usr/bin/love-release'
rm -rf '/usr/share/love-release'
rm -rf '/usr/share/man/man1/love-release.1.gz'
rm -rf '/usr/share/bash-completion/completions/love-release' '/etc/bash_completion.d/love-release'
```

## Contribute
The documentation of love-release internals is written with [LDoc][ldoc]. Generate it by running `ldoc .`.  
I do not plan to keep developing the Bash script, not even fixing it. If there appears to be any need for it, let me know and I might consider doing so.  
Every bug report or feature request is gladly welcome !
